# Programming Languages by Dan Grossman on Coursera

There are three parts for this course.

Part a uses Standard ML as the programming language. 
It is a statically typed language.

- Basics, functions, recursion, scope, variables, lists...
- Datatypes, pattern matching, tail recursion
- First-class functions, closures, lexical scoping
- Type inference, modules and equivalence

The three parts altogether constitute a one semester
